\section*{Abstract}
The purpose of the project is to simulate successful autonomous navigation of a delivery robot along sidewalks in a busy suburban environment from store to a delivery address on ground level.  It demonstrates global planning for high-level route planning with a hand-off to a local planner for obstacle avoidance.

\section*{Background}
Last mile delivery has been a growing issue with the increase in e-commerce over at least the last 8 years with each year growing from 15-30\% from the year before \cite{Ecom}.  Since much of this final delivery is accomplished via vehicles, the has been an accompanying call for reduced emissions.  A McKinsey study estimates that this could lead to a 25\% increase in CO2 emission in cities \cite{Emiss}.  Most recently, the COVID pandemic with its isolation mandates have led to even greater demand for delivery of not only goods but also everyday essentials such as meals, groceries, and prescription medicine.  This needed to be accomplished with minimal human contact while fewer humans were available due to quarantines and employee availability.  For grocery delivery, the need for fastest route planning is also necessary due to the presence of perishables and temperature sensitive cargo - or, in other words, people prefer their meals hot and their frozen goods cold. Cheng et al \cite{Mcheng} have shown efficient curb detection to set the limits of the robot's path.

\section*{Goals}
Our goal is to create planning and execution algorithms to permit autonomous navigation and avoidance of both static (dumpsters, trashcans, traffic cones, garbage cans and garbage bags) and dynamic obstacles (people, cars) while following sidewalk rules (staying on the sidewalk and crossing at crosswalks etc).

\subsection*{Robot Choice}
\textbf{Design} After research of the prevailing designs for this type of application, we've settled on a non-holonomic 6 wheeled robot using skid steering. It uses a simulated GPS sensor for a pre-determined, global path plan and simulated LIDAR for more specific localized obstacle avoidance during operation. \\

\noindent \textbf{Kinematics.} The kinematics for the robot are modeled on a diwheel design.  This resulted in the following state transition functions:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\dot{x}&=r(u_r+u_L)\cos\theta\\
\dot{y}&=r(u_r+u_L)\sin\theta\\
\dot{\theta}&=\frac{r}{L}(u_r-u_L)\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\noindent where$ L$ is the distance between the wheels, in our case .66 meters,  $r$ is the radius of the wheels (.1m) and $u$ is the rotational velocity of wheels of the left and right sides.\\

\section*{Methods}
\noindent \textbf{Global map}.  The overall map is overlayed with designated waypoints which may be turns, crosswalks, or delivery addresses.  This generates a master map of feasible routes which is translated into a graph representation for optimal global route selection via a number of algorithms.  Below demonstrates the environment map as well as the waypoint/graph representation.\\

     \label{fig:routemap}
     \caption{Global Route Map}
\end{figure}
\noindent \textbf{Planners} We selected a simple A* algorithm for global path selection.  With a given route map, no complexity is involved.  Each path segment returned represents a leg of the global route between waypoints.  Each leg is then, in turn, passed to the local planner which uses a slightly more complex A* to account for collision detection and reject off-limits positions.

     \label{fig:astar}
     \caption{A* Local Planner}
\end{figure}
\noindent \textbf{Simulation}. For simulating the environment we chose to use Pygame to capitalize on the collision detecting built into the sprite class.  A mask of the off-limits areas creates curb and building limits for our robot's movement.

     \caption{Initial Collision Map}
\end{figure}

\noindent \textbf{Obstacles}. In addition to off limits areas (buildings and streets-less-crosswalks) we place other obstacles into the environment.  These took the form of trashcans, trash bags, bicycles, dumpsters and traffic cones.  These obstacles were, of course, unknown to the global planner but register for the local planner as it seeks a path.  As part of the obstacle set, moving vehicles will be included on the roads to be avoided at the crosswalks.

\section*{Results}
We obviously tested in phases as we constructed.  The global planner worked flawlessly  as the first part tested after creation of the environment and global network.  No difficulties were encountered.  The local planner required some tuning of state variables to simply the question of "have we been her before?".  Initially small variations which were essentially the same state registered as different and bogged calculations.  As we incorporated some rounding, performance improved. \\
Integrating global and local planners worked well.  The global path handoff was successful and the local search found a mostly direct path.  Incorporating obstacles brought to light some interesting challenges.  If the obstacle happened to be covering the waypoint, it was impossible for the local search to complete.  One strategy might have been to abandon the immediate waypoint after a certain number of attempts and try to proceed to the next waypoint.  We chose instead to insure obstacles weren't directly on top of waypoints.  After that, we were able to navigate around all obstacles.  Some took longer that others depending on the collision space, but all eventually solved.  Moving obstacles....
